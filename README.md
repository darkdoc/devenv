## Quick usage
WIP!

Ubuntu/Debian/apt based  
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darkdoc/devenv/main/setup.sh | bash
```
(This is not yet implemented, but it should give some nice error if you try on ubuntu)  
Fedora/Redhat/yum based  
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darkdoc/devenv/main/setup.sh | bash -s -- --yum
```
