## Quick usage
WIP!

Ubuntu/Debian/apt based
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darkdoc/devenv/main/setup.sh| bash

(This is not yet implemented, but it should give some nice error if you try on ubuntu)
Fedora/Redhat/yum based
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darkdoc/devenv/main/setup.sh| bash -s -- --yum
